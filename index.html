    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p>he key structure I put in my mystery box is the tubes that lead down from the bucket that is taped to the top  of the box to the other bucket on the floor. I think that the tubes that are in the mystery box, because there needs to be a way that the water gets from one point of the box to the other.</p>
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p>There is this mystery Black box that has a funnel on top and a tube at the bottom. This mystery box when you pour in water, in this case 500ML but some water might come out, a lot more might come out or even nothing. As of right now I don't know what's in the box but I made a model to show what I think is in the box.</p>
    <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <h3>A model is a replicated object that is smaller or bigger than the original or other object.</h3>
    <h3>The tubes makes the water travel not as fast and makes it unpredictable.</h3>
    <h3>If there was no tubing or different size tubing then the water would of made it faster or slower than the tubes we used.</h3>
